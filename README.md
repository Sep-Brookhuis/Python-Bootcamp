# Python-Bootcamp
This repository contains all the exercises, mini-projects, and full projects I completed while following the "Python: From Zero to Hero" course on Udemy.

The projects cover a wide range of Python topics, including data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, file handling, and more. Each folder is organized by topic or section from the course.

This repo serves as a record of my learning journey and hands-on practice with Python.
